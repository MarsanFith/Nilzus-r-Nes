                         You see, New Zealand’s rivers are actually some of the most polluted in any OECD country.

                        Agriculture is the main cause of both water quality degradation and water pollution in New Zealand. Sediments, faecal microbes, phosphorus, dissolved nitrogen and even disease-causing pathogens, among other nutrients and chemicals are the contaminants from agriculture and diffuse pollution, and can be found inside many of our rivers and streams.  
                        Also linked to water quality degradation are hydropower, pest invasions and climate change. Industrial use, urban development, and an increase of overall population are also linked to water pollution.

                       In 2020, 60% of the river’s in New Zealand carried pollution above water quality guidelines, 95 to 99% of those being rivers that run through urban and farming areas.

                        According to the Ministry of the Environment, Auckland is the region with the most pollution in its waterways. In 2019, 62% of their lakes and rivers were given poor grades for swimming in, and none of them were given a good grade.
