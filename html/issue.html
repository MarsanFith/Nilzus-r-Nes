                         You see, New Zealandâ€™s rivers are actually some of the most polluted in any OECD country.

                        Agriculture is the main cause of both water quality degradation and water pollution in New Zealand. Sediments, faecal microbes, nitrogen, phosphorus, and even disease-causing pathogens, among other nutrients and chemicals are the contaminants from agriculture and diffuse pollution, and can be found inside many of our rivers and streams.  
                        Also linked to water quality degradation are hydropower, pest invasions and climate change. Industrial use, urban development, and an increase of overall population are linked to water pollution.

                        A side effect of the pollution in the water is the formation of toxic algae.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cyanobacteria, also known as toxic algae, can be found in many waterways, and in a range of different water qualities. When toxic algae starts rapidly multiplying, it forms cyanobacteria blooms, and these produce cyanotoxins, and when water containing it is swallowed, it can be harmful to both humans and animals. Some people can even have allergic reactions just touching the algae, causing things such as skin irritation, headaches, fevers, blisters, mouth ulcers, vomiting,  stomach cramps, diarrhoea, and muscle and joint pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These blooms can happen naturally, but the process is sped up by the nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture polluting the water.
