                        What's your first thought when you think of New Zealand? Some think of the beautiful landscapes, most others think of the copious amounts of sheep, and a few can't even find it on the map. <p>But if you are able to find us, then you've most likely heard of New Zealand's <i>clean green</i> appearance, our country's tourism slogan being, <i>"100% pure"</i>. This makes it seem that New Zealand is a healthy place for people to live, which is...<i>sort of</i> true. </p>
                    <p> 
                        It's true that we are 100% nuclear-free, and our air quality is pretty good, but what everyone, including ourselves, fail to notice is the quality of our water.
