                        What's your first thought when you think of New Zealand? Is it the fruit named after that bird? The copious amounts of sheep? Or maybe it's actually trying to find it on the map? (Disclaimer: It might not be on there)

                        If you've found us, though, then you've probably heard about how <i>clean</i> New Zealand is, or our country's tourism slogan, <b><i>"100% pure"</i></b>. From that, you'd think New Zealand was a healthy place for people to live, and for the most part, it is. We're 100% nuclear-free, and our air quality is really good as well.

                        But as it turns out, New Zealandâ€™s rivers are actually some of the most polluted in any OECD country.
