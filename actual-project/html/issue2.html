                        Broken sewers and faulty connections allow sewerage to enter stormwater systems. Also, during flooding sewerage pumping stations are inundated with the floodwaters and sewerage is released.

                        Water run-off from roads contains pollutants such as zinc, copper, lead and hydrocarbons from vehicle wear, vehicle emissions and from the road surface itself. Urban areas have large amounts of paved surface therefore there is a higher likelihood that water contaminated with organic matter will not be filtered through soils.
                        Sediment run-off from exposed soils in new subdivisions does occur and if it occurs due to breaches of the resource consent prosecution may result. To limit sediment run-off during earthworks straw bales and stormwater settling ponds are used. These are completely inadequate in high rainfall events where the interceptors are overwhelmed and silt laden waters flow into streams and rivers.

                        Other factors include Urban runoff, polluted with detergents, waste oil, litter and faecal matter, and Industrial processing involves the discharge of process waste-water to waterways.
