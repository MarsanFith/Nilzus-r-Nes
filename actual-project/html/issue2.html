                        Broken sewers and faulty connections allow sewerage to enter stormwater systems. Also, during flooding sewerage pumping stations are inundated with the floodwaters and sewerage is released.

                        Water run-off from roads contains pollutants such as zinc, copper and lead from wear and tear from your cars and such, as well as emissions from cars and from the road itself. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <u>Urban run-off</u>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Urban areas have large amounts of paved surface therefore there is a higher likelihood that water contaminated with organic matter will not be filtered through soils. Run-off from urban areas contains some detergents, oil, and especially litter, as well as faeces from pets with irresponsible owners.
