                        Agriculture is the main cause of both water quality degradation and water pollution in New Zealand. Sediments, faecal microbes, nitrogen, phosphorus, and even disease-causing pathogens, among other nutrients and chemicals are the contaminants that come from agriculture and diffuse pollution, and can be found inside many of our rivers and streams.

                        In 2020, <b>60%</b> of the riverâ€™s in New Zealand carried pollution above water quality guidelines, <b>95 to 99%</b> of those  being rivers that run through urban and farming areas.

                        Auckland is the region with the most pollution in its waterways. In 2019, the Ministry of the Environment gave <b>62%</b> of their lakes and rivers were given poor grades for swimming in, and absolutely <b>0%</b> were given a good grade.

                    <p>
                        A side effect of the pollution in the water is the formation of toxic algae.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cyanobacteria, also known as toxic algae, can be found in many waterways, and in a range of different water qualities. When toxic algae starts rapidly multiplying, it forms cyanobacteria blooms, and these produce cyanotoxins, and when water containing it is swallowed, it can be harmful to both humans and animals. Some people can even have allergic reactions just touching the algae, causing things such as skin irritation, headaches, fevers, blisters, mouth ulcers, vomiting,  stomach cramps, diarrhoea, and muscle and joint pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These blooms can happen naturally, but the process is sped up by the nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture polluting the water.

                    <p>
                        Broken sewers and faulty connections allow sewerage to enter stormwater systems. During a flood, sewerage pumping stations are overrun with the floodwater and sewerage is released. A mix between these two factors causes huge amounts of sewage to enter the ocean.

                    <p>
                        Water run-off from roads contains pollutants such as zinc, copper and lead, all from the wear and tear of cars and other vehicles, as well as emissions from cars and from the road itself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <u>Urban run-off</u>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Urban areas have large amounts of paved surface therefore there is a higher likelihood that water contaminated with organic matter will not be filtered through soils. Run-off from urban areas contains some detergents, oil, and especially litter, as well as faeces from pets with irresponsible owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both of these run-off enter stormdrains, which then takes both the water and pollutants into the ocean.
